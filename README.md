# Design Choices 

## Inspiration 
 
1.  https://samsbarbers.com/ 
* The fixed nav bar will be used to allow users to access pages at any point of the site, but the background colour will be solid and not transparent so the text is always visible 
* The social media icons will be included in header 

2. https://www.area9.ie/
* The sections on the page store will be similar to the sections used to provide examples of the different styles 
* Fixed nav bar with solid background colour so text is always visible 

3. https://www.waldorfbarbers.shop/
* Parallax on the hero image will be used as seen on this site 
* The colour scheme will be like this site 

## Fonts

I have used google fonts to select a font type that best supports the goals of the website, to provide users with cheap haircuts. For the main text I have selected [Comforta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) because the rounded edges portray a less serious, more fun, and approachable brand compared to a font with sharper edges such as [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel). To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Valera Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round).

## Images

It is important that the large background image used in the hero section portrays a happy customer to align with the fun, vibrant and approachable brand. 

Again, a less serious image portrays a more approach, less premium brand and with those lower costs. 

## Icons

The font awesome library will be used throughout the site for social media links, to provide visual aides for section headers, contact links, navigation links, and more. All icons will be consistent with the fun, approachable design of the brand. 

## Colours 

The inspiration for the colours was taken from the red, white, and blue of a traditional barber’s bar. I used the website colourmind to aid me with the selection of the specific colour scheme. I tested the colours I originally selected on the WebAIM contract checker, and it failed the test, this can be seen here. To improve the contrast ratio, I adjusted the colours manually until the test past, the final colours which passed the test can be seen here.
